										I am Hilag Shah.I am a First year undergraduate student pursuing
										my B.E in Information Technology(I.T) from D.Y Patil Institute
										of Technology,Pimpri,Pune and I am a native of Vadodara,
										Gujarat.I am also a certified coder in C,C++ and Java.I have also 
										worked on two of my very own projects by learning from various sources.
										I am currently also enhancing my knowledge on HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and 
										Scratch so as to dive in the arena of Front End Development.

											My purpose of programming is to build tools for people which would play
											an important role in shaping their future lives.I am currently living 
											in India and I also want to play a little but effective role in shaping 
											the future of the country in the technical field.
										</p>
										<p id="projects">
											Alongwith being  a certified coder I was also a nominee in the GYLF's
											Karamveer Chakra Awards hosted by IIT Delhi for my work in programming 
											in 2019.<br>
											I also participated in the Vadodara School Tech Meet hosted by Bright
											School,Vadodara where me and my team from Navrachana School,Sama,Vadodara
											made a result compiler and storage system which would let the workers in competetive 
											exams give results in lesser amount of time.<br>
											I myself have been working on building a periodic table and a spiral as 
											my side projects.<br>
											In First Year of engineering we have also built an Arduino based Obstacle 
											Detection Car which would detect upcoming obstacles and help in maintaining 
											the safety and scurity of the driver and wold also contribute in shaping lives 
											of many blind and handicapped people dreaming of driving a car.

									<h3><a href="#">Periodic Table</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This is my best project so far.My idea behind this was to memorize the 
									periodic table.As a result,I successfully build this beatiful neon 
									periodic table which gives information about all the elements 
									and also helps to provide a more practical understanding of the
									different elements.

									<h3><a href="#">Spiral</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have built a spiral animation which I learnt to code from a website
									HTML codes website.From here I learnt how overlapping 2D images help
									create  a beautiful animated 3D model.It was quite and interesting 
									project and helped me learn in depth coding in Html.
